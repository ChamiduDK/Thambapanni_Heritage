                <h2>Sri Lankan History about Pottery</h2>
                <p>Sri Lankan pottery dates back over 3,000 years, deeply interwoven with the island's cultural and artistic heritage. Early pottery was primarily used for practical purposes such as food storage, cooking, and religious offerings. The traditional pottery industry thrived in ancient kingdoms, where artisans crafted intricate clay items using natural resources like riverbed clay. Even today, many rural communities uphold these traditions, creating pottery that carries the legacy of Sri Lanka’s past.</p>
