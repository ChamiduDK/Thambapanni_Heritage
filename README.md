This project is developed as part of the Higher National Diploma (HND) in Software Engineering at Cardiff Metropolitan University. It aims to create an online platform to promote, preserve, and showcase authentic Sri Lankan cultural heritage and crafts.

Project Title: “Sri Lankan Cultural Heritage and Crafts Marketplace”

Project Description: Sri Lanka is globally recognized for its rich cultural diversity and traditional craftsmanship, including handicrafts, paintings, textiles, and sculptures. However, many talented artisans lack access to modern platforms to display their products and reach wider audiences. This project addresses this gap by offering a dedicated e-commerce and showcase platform tailored specifically for Sri Lankan cultural products.

The platform enables local artisans to showcase their work, connect with buyers, and receive custom orders. It combines e-commerce functionality with a freelance-style marketplace to empower creators and preserve cultural heritage.

Key Features: Creator Profiles – Artisans can register, manage their profiles, and upload product details. Product Showcase – Display cultural products with images, descriptions, and pricing. Order Management – Customers can place direct orders, track progress, and make payments. Secure Payment Integration – Payments via PayPal or Stripe for secure transactions. Admin Panel – Allows website monitoring, order management, and user activity tracking. Responsive Design – Optimized for desktop and mobile devices for ease of use.

Technologies Used: Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Backend: PHP. Database: MySQL for secure and scalable data storage. Hosting: Hostinger for deployment and scalability. Version Control: GitHub for source code collaboration and version management.

Project Goals: Promote Sri Lankan cultural products globally. Provide a user-friendly interface for artisans and buyers. Ensure secure transactions and data privacy. Empower local artisans through a centralized digital platform. Support scalability for future growth and feature expansions.
